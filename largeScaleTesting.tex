\section{Large Scale Testing}
The floating platform was tested in a small pool at MTC (Miljötekniskt Centrum) in Umeå. We saw that it was possible to steer and control the the floating platform in the enclosed environment without problem. It was also possible to run the RBRs at their ideal speed (around 500 rpm) and still have more power to give if needed. The test also revealed that the battery life was sufficient, that it was more than enough to clean a pool of our test size.

A test was performed, where we ran the RBR motors at about 500 rpm for 30 minutes, in order to see the heat accumulation in them. As the RBR motors did not reach a high temperature and had almost the same temperature after 10 minutes, as after 30 minutes it will probably not overheat.

As for the controller, a distance test in non open terrain showed that the controller and receiver works up to a distance of 600 meters.
