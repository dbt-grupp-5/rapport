\section{Radio Controller}
\subsection{Steering}
The Layout of the buttons on the controller can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:controller_front}, and \ref{fig:controller_back} for the front, and back of the controller respectively. In Figure \ref{fig:controller_front} the \textit{Rudder/Elevator stick} is used to control the speed of propellers driving the boat forward. The propellers will be still when the stick is in the lowest position in the figure, and will have max speed when the stick is in the top most position in the figure. Note that the stick should be put in the lowest position when the electronics of the boat is powered on.

The \textit{Throttle/Aileron Stick} is used to control the air rudder. Moving the stick to the right will turn the boat to the right and moving it to the left will turn the boat left.

The stick on the back of the controller, the \textit{VRC SW} stick in Figure \ref{fig:controller_back} is used to control the rotational speed of the RBRs. If the stick is in the bottom most position the RBRs will not rotate. By moving the stick upwards the speed will increase until the stick is in the top position.
